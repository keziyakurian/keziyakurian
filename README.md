### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,README? I FEEL ATTACKED



- you already know my name, it's like right there 
- I am a Third year Computer Science Engineering student from Karnataka, India. I do code, I don't wanna restrict myself to a specific domain so I learn whatever I like. Instead of being good at one domain, now I'm bad at multiple domains (gg i played myself)
- Honestly I'm making this readme thingy to keep me motivated to do the dream readme on github that is a long list of languages and tools I know (just kill me already). I have decided to do projects on cloud technologies, building website, devolop softwares and so on 
- let's just pretend all my projects are private for now (I need emotional support here)


Skills: MACHINE LEARNING / PYTHON / JS / HTML / CSS
tools: VSCODE / QISKIT
